        <h2>About</h2>
        <p><em><strong>piefull</strong></em> is a fairly trivial script to allow inline pie-charts, currently representing a single value expressed as a percentage.</p>
        <p>Examples where this could be useful include resource allocation, task completion status, and so on.</p>
        <p>Elements which have class <code>piefull</code> will have their content parsed and if something which looks like a number is found therein, the element will be <em>replaced</em> with a pie-chart canvas.</p>
